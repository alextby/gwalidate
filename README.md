GWalidate
===============
<p>
GWalidate is a simple and lightweight client-side GWT validation framework. <br/>
It aims to address the shortcomings of the GWT's built-in <i>javax.validation.*</i> support allowing the client code
to specify extended validation configurations in a per-widget manner.

<h3>Build Instructions</h3>
 - Java7 is preferably the one to go with.
 - Building `gwalidate-core` with Java8 won't let the tests run, so make sure to `-DskipTests=true` if Java8 is required (the rest of the code compiles/runs as expected).
 - `gwalidate-playground` has `-P dev` for faster developer builds (less permutations and tests skipped)
 - Compiling `gwalidate-core` (GWalidate.gwt.xml imported) included in a GWT 2.7 project is perfectly possible and supported. `gwalidate` still has gwt version 2.6.1 in the pom, but that's mostly because the unitests won't run under gwt version 2.7. There is a mid-term plan to migrate to either 2.7 or 3.0.

<h3>Standalone Demo</h3>
Is for looking into the usage details of the framework. Steps to launch at localhost:
```sh
  mvn clean install
  cd gwalidate-playground/
  mvn jetty:deploy-war
